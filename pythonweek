Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class!

Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.

Kaylin Everett. This seems like a good tool to collaborate when writing programs.
Erick, still learning GitHub.

Alexandra Moreno- Github seems overly complicated at first but I can see how it can be beneficial when coders are collaborating. It definitely is nice seeing changes instantly to code. 
Erick, I like github, and I think that once I know how to use it, my students would also like to learn it. I see some benefits for research.
Erick, I believe my students would learn github faster and would like it.
I am trying to get this assignment done.
